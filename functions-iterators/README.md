# Functions, loops, and conditionals, oh my!!

#### WRITE ALL YOUR ANSWERS IN `starter.js` file. Test early, test often! Remember, you can use node for that by typing `node starter.js` in your terminal. 

#### But, you'll have to run this script in a web browser for some of the later questions since they ask you to use alerts and prompts. Instructions on how to do this are in `starter.js`.

### PART 0: Just DO it!!
Write a function `justDoIt` that accepts a string, your name, as an argument. The function should **return** a string that has your argument and the phrase "JUST DO IT".

```javascript
//example usage
justDoIt('Zack');
// => "Zack, JUST DO IT!";
```

### PART 1: Big or Small String?

#### You may have to dig into some documentation for some of these!

Write a **function** called `bigOrSmallString` that accepts one argument, a string, and returns "This word is loooooong!" if the string's length is greater than 10, and "This word is short ðŸ˜¬" otherwise.

### PART 2: Odd or Even String Length?
Write a **function** called `oddOrEvenString` that accepts one argument, a string, and **returns**
*"This string's length is odd.."* if the length is an odd number, and *"This string length is TOTALLY even!"* if the string length is even.

### PART 3: Median
Write a **function** called `medianOfArray` that takes an **array** as an argument.
The function should **return** the *median* number in an array.
Hmmmm, haven't you found a median of the array before? Maybe not..
> *Hint*: Use some kind of sorting method to put the values in order first, then somehow access the median element, somehow using the length of the array....maybe? We're going to go over arrays in depth on Monday but see if you can find some Array methods that can accomplish what you need.

### PART 4: Sum Array

Create a **function** called `sumArray` that takes an array `arr` as an argument and **returns the sum** of all the numbers in the array. If the array is empty then return 0.

### PART 5: Vowel Count
Create a **function** called `vowelCount` that accepts a `str` as an argument and **returns** the number of vowels in that string.
